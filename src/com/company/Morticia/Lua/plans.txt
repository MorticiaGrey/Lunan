  - makeFile(String path): Creates file at specified path, if it doesn't already exist. returns true/false if successful
  - readFile(String path): Reads contents of file at path if it can. returns true/false if successful
  - writeFile(String path, String contents): Writes contents to file at path, creates new file if none exists returns true/false if successful

  - read(String option): reads input from console but will filter depending on option
  - read(int lower, int upper): reads input from console but only returns the characters from the specified bounds

  - execute(String cmd): Executes same way as command, looks for files in path then local folder if not objective path. If
  objective path (i.e. /home/bunny_boi/commands/test.lu) goes right to that file. Anything after file to execute is arg,
