Hello! And welcome to Hood.

This network is owned by us so anything you do won't set off alarms, but if you were worried about that is might not be for you.
The objective is simple: hack into the only other machine on this network, and delete the data in the /data/flag.txt file. Easy!

We left some notes in your home directory you might want to take a look at, unless of course you'd rather try
to figure it out all on your own.

Good luck!
